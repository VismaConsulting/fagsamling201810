I'm a Croat who moved to Norway for love and, as I would only find out later, to discover the amazing world of wool! And I haven't stopped knitting since.

During my recent maternity leave, I realised I needed to use my brain more to not get stuck in the baby-bubble, so I decided to start writing patterns.

I hope you find something you like!:)
